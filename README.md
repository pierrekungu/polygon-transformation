# Polygon Transformation
This Python program uses the Turtle graphics library to create and transform polygons. It allows users to define straight-line and Bezier curve polygons, perform various transformations, and save/load polygons to/from files.
## How to Use
### Create Straight-Line Polygon:
Choose between keyboard input and mouse clicks.
Keyboard Input: Enter vertices manually. Press 'D' to save or 'T' to perform transformations.
Mouse Clicks: Click on the screen to define polygon vertices. Right-click for the main menu.
### Create Bezier Polygon:
Choose between straight and curved lines.
Straight Line: Enter start and end coordinates.
Curved Line: Enter four coordinates for the Bezier curve.
Press 'D' to save to a file.
### Load Polygon:
Load a previously saved polygon from a CSV file.
### Save Polygon:
Save the current polygon to a CSV file.
### Transform Polygon:
Choose from various transformations:

Reflect (X Axis)

Reflect (Y Axis)

Rotate

Scale

Translate

### Exit:
Terminate the program.
